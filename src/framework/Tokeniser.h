 *
 * @brief Accepts an input string and splits the string up into separate "tokens" which can be handled individually.
 * The main use for this is in a console environment where you need to act on the arguments submitted along with a command.
 * For example, a typical scenario would be that the command "set_value foo bar" was entered. The command object would then be "set_value", and the following string would need to be split into "tokens" (i.e. two tokens, "foo" and "bar").
