 * @author Erik Hjortsberg <erik.hjortsberg@gmail.com>
 * @brief Provides nodes for skeleton bones.
 *
 * When a MovableObject is attached to a skeleton the resulting Node is a TagPoint. This differs some from a SceneNode, which is the normal node we deal with.
 * The largest difference is that a SceneNode can be nestled in a hierarchy of SceneNodes: not so with the TagPoint. A TagPoint can have no children.
 * Furthermore, a TagPoint can only have one MovableObject attached to it.
 * These restrictions make it so that we need to provide our own hierarchy, so that child ModelBoneProvider instances are registered with the instance that they are children of. When the position or orientation of the parent changes, so must the children also be updated.
