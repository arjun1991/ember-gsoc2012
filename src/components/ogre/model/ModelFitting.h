 * An instance of this is used to keep track of which entities are attached to which attach points on a model.
 * Note that it's not until attachChild() has been called that there's an entity attached.
 * This is because it's not uncommon for the attribute data which tells that a certain entity should be attached to be available before the actual entity is available.
