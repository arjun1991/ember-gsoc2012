    /** Abstract base class representing a high-level program (a vertex or
        fragment program).
    @remarks
        High-level programs are vertex and fragment programs written in a high-level
        language such as Cg or HLSL, and as such do not require you to write assembler code
        like GpuProgram does. However, the high-level program does eventually 
        get converted (compiled) into assembler and then eventually microcode which is
        what runs on the GPU. As well as the convenience, some high-level languages like Cg allow
        you to write a program which will operate under both Direct3D and OpenGL, something
        which you cannot do with just GpuProgram (which requires you to write 2 programs and
        use each in a Technique to provide cross-API compatibility). Ogre will be creating
        a GpuProgram for you based on the high-level program, which is compiled specifically 
        for the API being used at the time, but this process is transparent.
    @par
        You cannot create high-level programs direct - use HighLevelGpuProgramManager instead.
        Plugins can register new implementations of HighLevelGpuProgramFactory in order to add
        support for new languages without requiring changes to the core Ogre API. To allow 
        custom parameters to be set, this class extends StringInterface - the application
        can query on the available custom parameters and get/set them without having to 
        link specifically with it.

        @remarks

            program and therefore must be created from it rather than by the 
            HighLevelGpuProgramManager. This method creates a new instance of a parameters
            object containing the definition of the parameters this program understands.
