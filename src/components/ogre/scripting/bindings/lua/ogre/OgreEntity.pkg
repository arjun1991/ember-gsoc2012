	/** Defines an instance of a discrete, movable object based on a Mesh.
	@remarks
	Ogre generally divides renderable objects into 2 groups, discrete
	(separate) and relatively small objects which move around the world,
	and large, sprawling geometry which makes up generally immovable
	scenery, aka 'level geometry'.
	@par
	The Mesh and SubMesh classes deal with the definition of the geometry
	used by discrete movable objects. Entities are actual instances of
	objects based on this geometry in the world. Therefore there is
	usually a single set Mesh for a car, but there may be multiple
	entities based on it in the world. Entities are able to override
	aspects of the Mesh it is defined by, such as changing material
	properties per instance (so you can have many cars using the same
	geometry but different textures for example). Because a Mesh is split
	into SubMeshes for this purpose, the Entity class is a grouping class
	(much like the Mesh class) and much of the detail regarding
	individual changes is kept in the SubEntity class. There is a 1:1
	relationship between SubEntity instances and the SubMesh instances
	associated with the Mesh the Entity is based on.
	@par
	Entity and SubEntity classes are never created directly. Use the
	createEntity method of the SceneManager (passing a model name) to
	create one.
	@par
	Entities are included in the scene by associating them with a
	SceneNode, using the attachEntity method. See the SceneNode class
	for full information.
	@note
	No functions were declared virtual to improve performance.
