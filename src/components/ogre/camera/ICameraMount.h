/**
 * @author Erik Hjortsberg <erik.hjortsberg@gmail.com>
 *
 * @brief A mount for a camera.
 *
 * The camera mount is responsible for handling how the camera is moved and rotated. This is independent from the MainCamera class to allow for many different styles of camera attachment. The most obvious ones would be a third person camera mount, and a first person mount.
 * The MainCamera class can only be attached to one mount at a time. This is done by calling the MainCamera::attachToMount() method. When the camera is attached to a mount, that mount will receive calls to pitch() and yaw(), asking it to update its orientation.
 * When the user wants to move, the mount will also receive calls to move(). This allow the different types of mounts to implement different movement styles. A camera which is attached to an entity would for example probably want to try to move the entity within the world, whereas a free flying camera would want to move the camera directly.
 * In most cases the handling of the motion will need to be separated from the actual mount, and therefore the setMotionHandler() method is provided.
