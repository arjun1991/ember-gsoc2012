 @brief A graphical, and editable, representation of a polygon.
 A Polygon is a 2d shape, made up of multiple connected points.
 This class can be used for represent it graphically in the world, and allow for easy editing through dragging and dropping.
 To alter a point, just drag and drop it. To create a new point, drag an existing one and press and hold ctrl.
