/**
 @brief A bridge to the entity. Any instance of this is responsible for making sure that the entity is properly moved.

 This acts as an abstraction for the actual entity, relieving the other components in the movement framework from altering the entity directly.
 Note that this deals with world space only, which means that all orientations and positions are relative to the world, not the parent entity.

 All movement that happens through this class will be on the client only, until either finalizeMovement() or cancelMovement() are called.
