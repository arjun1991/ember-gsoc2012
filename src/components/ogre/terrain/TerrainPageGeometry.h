 @author Erik Hjortsberg <erik.hjortsberg@gmail.com>
 @brief Handles the geometry of a terrain page.

 Each instance of TerrainPage is light weight, and doesn't hold any terrain data. This data is also volatile, as we don't want to keep it in memory all the time. The main reason for this is that with a large terrain the amount of needed memory just for the terrain would grow very large.
 Instead we use an instance of this each time we want to access terrain data. Each instance of this class is meant to be in use a very short time. As soon as it's destroyed the Segments used by it will be returned to the SegmentManager, and optionally have had their memory freed.
