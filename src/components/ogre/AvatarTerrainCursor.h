 * @brief Provides an easy way to get the terrain position currently under the cursor.
 *
 * An instance of this is usually held only by the AvatarCamera.
 * The class will take care of checking when either the mouse or camera has moved, and won't do a new ray check until any of those two has changed. This helps with keeping the performance up. It's therefore ok to call getTerrainCursorPosition every frame.
 *
 * If the mouse position has been updated a new ray check will always be executed, but if only the camera has been moved the update of the ray check will only happen after a certain interval, which can be set through setThreshold(unsigned int).
