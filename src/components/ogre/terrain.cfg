#65 seems to be the sweet spot, as it guarantees 16 bit indices
#129 would seem better, as it would mean a smaller amount of batches, but it seems that using 32 bit indices makes the system stutter when new indices are loaded and optimized

# What to generate
# HERE IS WHERE YOU SPECIFY YOUR NEEDS
#
# If you want your map to be infinitizable
InfiniteMap=no

# If you want smooth your heightmap
HeightMapBlurFactor=0.0f
# Make sure heights use the whole range (0-255 or 0-65535)
Equalize=no
# usual 8 bits HeightMap (terrain scene manager)
HeightMap=yes
# Creates a MiniMap (width=numpageswidth*numtiles and height=numpagesheight*numtiles)
# (as the name don't tell, it's creates a file.small.png image...)

#########NORMALS
#
# Normal Map
NormalMap=yes
# RGB as XYZ normal and Alpha as 8 bits HeightMap (paging scene manager)
HeightNormalMap=no


#
# Map that can be used on not too much scaled terrain or old hardware
# no enough texture units or too slow multipass (Textureformat=Image)

#########SPLATTING

# Base map for big scale maps, used for long distance instead of splatting
# (Textureformat=Base and splattingX)

# same but with modulated with light
LitBaseMap=no
#
#### Maps used for splattings
#
# coverage is RGBA, each channel has info for 1 splat
# (Textureformat=splatting3)
CoverageMap=no
#
# generate 1 alpha map per splatting
# (Textureformat=splatting2) When Ogre has support fo PF_A8
AlphaMaps=no
# same but with black RGB data until Ogre has support fo PF_A8
AlphaSplatRGBAMaps=no
# same but with light in RGB data
AlphaSplatLightMaps=no
#
# generate 1 RGB map per splatting gray level instead of alpha
# (mainly debug, but can be used to get some splatting in GL version one day)

######## Real-Time LIGHTING

# Horizon Mapping (real-time lightmapping shader with V2 pixel shader)
# LONG TIME COMPUTATION

# map elevation lookup table independant, so generate once and rename according to your materials.
ElevationMap=no

# trick Real-Time mapping : sun is constricted in Z axis. Fastest Horizon mapping possible with and without shaders.
ZHorizon=yes


########VISIBILITY
#
# PVS (potential visibility set)
# VERY LONG TIME COMPUTATION
# Will be used to decide if terrain patches are visible or hidden by some hills
# or mountains (not used for now in plugin's code)
# could be used for AI to know if something is visible from a point to another...
# so perhaps a thing that can lies in scenemanagers...

################## PERFORMANCES OPTIONS.
#
#
#
#           Visible renderables
#               This is the number of visible renderables from the current camera position
#               to the border of the visible terrain. (The radius of renderables)
VisibleRenderables=64
#

#  LOD : LEVEL OF DETAIL
#
# if not set, it's precomputed to the max possible at this TileSize.
# Must be (2^MaxRendervel < TileSize)
#MaxRenderLevel=5
#
#
#           FPS Processing limit
#     number of renderables loading in a single frame (if needed)

#  WINDOWING AROUND CAMERA
#
#           Num of adjacent loaded landscape pages.
MaxAdjacentPages=2
#

#           Num of adjacent preloaded landscape pages.
#               Must be bigger than MaxAdjacentPages + 1, the textures are loaded in a separate thread.
MaxPreloadedPages=3

#           Pages Load Factor

#           Camera Threshold
#               If the last camera position minus current camera position is >= CameraTheshold

CameraThreshold=5

#
#           Memory Pool Initial Usage Values (pre-allocated renderables and tiles.)
