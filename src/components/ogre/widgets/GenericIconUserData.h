 * @brief A very lightweight class which can be used as a "user data" instance in CEGUI.
 * CEGUI allows for "user data" to be attached to windows. The user data can be anything, and this class is used as a means to bind a generic icon to a CEGUI::Window.
 * Whenever it's used it must be wrapped in boost::any to allow for safe casting.
